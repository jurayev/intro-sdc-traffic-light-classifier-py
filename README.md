# Traffic Light Classifier

Udacity Intro to Self-Driving-Car Nanodegree

## Project Summary

In this project I builded a classification pipeline that takes in an image of a traffic light, analysis it using computer vision and outputs a label that classifies the image as a: Red, Yellow, or Green illuminated traffic light.

Classification Pipeline includes:
1. Loading and visualizing the data.
2. Pre-processing and standardazing the input images.
3. Feature extraction.
4. Classification of a model.
5. Evaluation of the model.
